Calendar -- Project


I was able to get a full calendar that selects dates or series of dates, but i was not reach getting the event controller to post on the calendar i had instead of the apple calendar. I got it to show event dots. The calendar goes to each month vertically, so swipe up to see the next month. To do the event on the calendar in my project, i would have to store the calendar in a view controller and by the time i realized that i didn't really have enough time to implement it for the project run.
